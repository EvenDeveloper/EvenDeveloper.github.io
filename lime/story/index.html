        <b>Turn on the dark</b> <br>
        In iOS 13, some of the coolest things happen in the dark. To see how, go to Settings > Display & Brightness, and in the Appearance section at the top of the screen, choose Dark. You can also use the Night Shift option to automatically shift the colours of your display to the warmer end of the spectrum at sunset (or whenever you prefer). <br> <br>
        
        Below you'll find some of our favourite apps that have been updated to shine in the dark.
